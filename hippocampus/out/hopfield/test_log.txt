STARTING SIMULATION FOR out/hopfield/test
Pattern directory contains 2048 neurons, 3 categories, and 512 examples
Sparsenseses detected: 0.020 and 0.200

STARTING NETWORK SETUP
Storing 3 categories with 100 examples
Testing 30 cues
Maximizing overlap w.r.t. theta using 2 rounds of 7 values
Theta search range from 0.290 to 0.710

STARTING THETA SEARCH ROUND 1 of 2

Round 1, theta = 0.320: done in 0.06 s, mean overlap 0.846
Round 1, theta = 0.380: done in 0.05 s, mean overlap 0.960
Round 1, theta = 0.440: done in 0.04 s, mean overlap 0.996
Round 1, theta = 0.500: done in 0.05 s, mean overlap 1.001
Round 1, theta = 0.560: done in 0.04 s, mean overlap 1.001
Round 1, theta = 0.620: done in 0.04 s, mean overlap 1.001
Round 1, theta = 0.680: done in 0.04 s, mean overlap 1.001
Maximum overlap achieved by multiple theta values, reporting mean
Full overlap of 1.000 achieved by theta = 0.620 in round 1

THETA SEARCH: 0.620 ACHIEVES MAXIMUM MEAN OVERLAP 1.001

STARTING FINAL SIMULATION
Done in 0.23 s
Mean overlap 0.985 --> 1.001 achieved by theta = 0.620
